# Titanic_Survival_Prediction

The goal of this project is to design machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using the famous Titanic dataset.
The model will analyze various demographic and travel-related attributes to determine the likelihood of survival, offering a binary classification: Survived(1) or Not Survived(0).

By analyzing the dataset, we aim to uncover insights into the key factors that influenced survival rates. Through this process, we will apply a systematic approach to preprocess the data, engineer meaningful features, and build high-performing classification models. Ultimately, this project serves as an opportunity to explore real-world applications of machine learning while gaining a deeper understanding of predictive analytics and historical trends.
